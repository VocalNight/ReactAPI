# ReactAPI

### This was another small project to create an API in .NET and consume it using a small front-end page in React
The challenge was here: https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/36

### Takeaways
This was not very complicated, i'm getting used to using .NET to create small API's.
The brunt of the development time was getting familiar with React and finding how to properly do routing since a new version of the routing api has come out and it changed quit significantly how you do that.

I also took a look at the testing stuff but this was a very simple app so there wasn't really much to test at all.

Overall, it was a very simple project!
